# How to contribute

Hi there! Thanks for sharing some interest!

There are different parts that you can contribute to. I think the primary area to ask for help in would be populating the dataset for exercises.

## Target market

The target users for this training exercise are people who are completely new to programming and wants to learn how to 'read' code.

The goal is to provide a very simple multiple choice/flash card exercise app, that people can use (and contribute to), paving the way for more developers to learn how to code.
